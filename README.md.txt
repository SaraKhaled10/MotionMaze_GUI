WELCOME TO MOTION MAZE!

Motion Maze is a simple and exciting motion-controlled game that we’ve created for you to enjoy! In this game, you control a red circle (the player) using an accelerometer, and your goal is to move the red circle to the green box at the end of each level. The game consists of 3 levels, with increasing difficulty as you progress.

To play, you’ll tilt the accelerometer in different directions to move the red circle. Be careful of the black rectangles scattered throughout the maze, as they are obstacles. If you hit one, the game will end. Along the way, you’ll find blue circles, which are power-ups. If you collect one, it will protect you from hitting a wall once, and a message will appear in the console to let you know that the protection is active.

Once you start the game, the buzzer will sound to signal the beginning. You can pause the game at any time by pressing the push button when you do, the RGB LED will turn red. Press the button again to resume, and the RGB LED will turn blue. If you manage to finish all three levels by reaching the green box, you’ll be rewarded with a congratulations message.

To get started, simply upload the Arduino code to your Lilypad board and make sure all the necessary components (accelerometer, RGB LED, push button, buzzer, and ZigBee) are connected. After that, run the Java game program on your computer using Eclipse. A game window will pop up, and you’ll be ready to start playing using the accelerometer to control your movements. Enjoy!
